# TwitterTimeLineFilterEF
A tool to display your Twitter timeline that can be filtered by custom tags. **(requires a twitter developer account!)**

## Setup
1. Get yourself a Twitter developer account [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en). I trust you to look up a guide how to yourself.
2. Create a new Project there. You only need read only permissions for this.
3. Copy your tokens to `/Data/Credentials1.cs` in the according const fields.
4. Rename the file name and class in that File to **Credentials**
5. Build the application.
6. Run the program and enjoy.
